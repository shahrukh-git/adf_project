# API to SQL Incremental ETL Pipeline using Azure Data Factory 
# About
* Designed and implemented an end-to-end Azure Data Factory pipeline to extract data from external APIs and ingest it into Azure Data Lake Storage (ADLS) for scalable processing.
* Developed a Data Flow to clean, transform, and stage raw data from ADLS to SQL Server using dynamic mappings and incremental load strategies.
* Automated data refresh by integrating Delete activity to remove stale data and ensure consistency during each pipeline run.
* Utilized Stored Procedure activity to load transformed data from the staging table to the final SQL table, applying business logic and maintaining data integrity.
